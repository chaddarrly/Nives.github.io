      <h3>Course Content and Social Work Integration:</h3>
      <p>I currently integrate course content into my social work practice and will continue to do so. I will be aware of the language I use. It is important to use language that does not re-traumatize people. Many also might not understand or agree with their diagnosis, so instead of saying their diagnosis while speaking with the person describe and discuss symptoms. It is a necessity to view the person we serve as a whole person and not as a “client” or “patient,” or their diagnosis. People are more than their diagnoses. Many people have multiple roles like parent, child, student, and/or worker. I will be aware of my biases and the system’s biases. I reflect on my day and my interactions with the people I serve throughout the day. I reflect on what I could have done differently or what I did that I thought was an appropriate approach.</p>
<p>
I will continue using assessments, creating recovery plans, crisis plans, and developing care/treatment plans. I started creating care plans two and a half years ago while working at DePaul. This was before I learned about it during my BSW. I have observed that each organization creates care plans differently, but a person-centered approach is always used. I will also implement the Circle of Support Exercise in my social work practice. I currently work with a handful of people I work with that need assistance with identifying their support circle and/or are in need of expanding their support circle. I really enjoyed learning about the cultural formulation interview (CFI) and will be integrating this into my social work practice. I think it is critical to get the client’s perspective and using CFI questions is an effective way of doing so. Many people might get misdiagnosed, mistreated, or ignored because the professionals they went to did not have empathy or understand their culture or even willing to learn about their culture. It is critical to remember that the people and communities we serve are experts of their own lives. During my social work career, I have already had to educate people I have worked with or coordinated care with. I had to explain to them that we are professionals and experts, but the people we serve are experts of their own lives. There are many professionals that are educated as they are experts, so this will be an ongoing teaching experience. My cultural humility will continue to be a learning experience. I will continue to listen to people’s stories and ask open-ended questions to learn more about their culture and spirituality. Someone’s culture and spirituality could be their support and strengths. Knowing and learning about these strengths could help them overcome barriers.</p>
<p id="integration">
I will continue to keep up to date with politics and social injustices. I will continue to advocate for policy changes for the people and community I serve. It is important to me to not just represent the people I serve, but the community too. What happens in the community affects the people I serve. For example, not finding housing due to high rent. Therefore, I will reach out to our representative to advocate for lower rent and tenants' rights. I will also continue to have conversations with people with different beliefs. I believe these conversations are important and might help each other learn and see from a different perspective. I have come to realize that although we might have different beliefs, many of us fight for the same things. The more people we have to advocate for change, the more significant dent we can make.
